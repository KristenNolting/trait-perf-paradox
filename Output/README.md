In the Model Fits folder:

These are the 'brms' model fits saved for each of the models run.

1. Models with a "_mod.rds" suffix correspond to the multiple regressions fit from the "multiple_regressions.R" script in the \Code folder.

2. Models with a "_var.rds" suffix correspond to the regressions fit from the "variance_partitioning.R" script in the \Code folder.

3. Models with a "_mod_no_REs.rds" suffix correspond the the multiple regressions fit from the "pc-functional-axis-alignment.R" script in the \Code folder.
