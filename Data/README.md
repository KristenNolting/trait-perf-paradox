Empirical data used in the manuscript titled: "When traits vary across species but performance doesn't: One solution to the paradox".

The full dataset was first presented in Nolting et al. (2021). Full citation:

For the present analyses we subset the data to 132 observations, and included eight structural traits and six physiological performance traits. We also included site and species IDs as identifying information. Below are descriptions of the column names in the Protea_data.R dataframe (after running through the Data_Wrangling.R script in the \Code folder), which is used in all analyses (excluding the simulation).
